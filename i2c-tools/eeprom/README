This directory contains scripts to decode the data exposed by the eeprom
Linux kernel driver.

* decode-dimms (perl script)
  Decode the information found in memory module SPD EEPROMs. The SPD
  data is read either from the running system or from dump files.

* decode-vaio (perl script)
  Decode the information found in Sony Vaio laptop identification EEPROMs.

* ddcmon (perl script)
  decode-edid (perl script)
  Decode the information found in monitor EEPROMs. Both scripts require
  an access to the DDC channel of the monitor. This is typically provided
  by framebuffer drivers. decode-edid additionally requires parse-edid,
  which is part of the read-edid package. ddcmon prints general
  information, while decode-edid prints timing information for
  inclusion into your X11 configuration file.

* decode-xeon (perl script)
  ID ROM data decoding for Xeon processors. Support for sysfs is still
  missing, so this script doesn't work with 2.6 kernels yet.
